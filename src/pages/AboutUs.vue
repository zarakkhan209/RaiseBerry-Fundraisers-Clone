        RaiseBerry was created by two fathers that wanted to solve a big problem: The Fundraising Nightmare that is paying for sports. Eventually it grew and as they started taking on the problem they realized they could solve fundraising problems for more than just little league sports programs.

        Together, Dallas Clements and Spencer Taylor, found holes in fundraising systems and have been working to fix them and make them easier for all involved. They've made fundraising easier by allowing links and QR codes to be shared, instead of having to tote around a wagon full of chocolate bars. Unless that's your thing, you can still order products for on the spot sales. They've made the products people buy of higher quality; gourmet chocolates instead of those same old chocolate bars we sold in 1990. They've made it easier for Grandma in Mississippi to buy something from Junior in Alaska, by shipping products to customers instead of having the kids do it.

        Dallas and Spencer immediately knew RaiseBerry was a great idea because they knew it would help so many others. They're committed to growing this business into a platform any program can use to alleviate their problems, and there's much much more on the horizon.
